# UserManagementAPI

This is an API made specifically for the mockup site that i made https://github.com/MichaelTae/UserManagementWeb

It's very simple and was created to have something for the main site to consume. 

It only contains users, tickets and usertickets(tickets that users have "bought") and as for the functionality it presents different metrics regarding users, for instance age or gender.
